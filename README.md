# R-TYPE

This project is a reproduction of the famous game R-Type. R-Type is a classic horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up video game that was first released by Irem Corporation in 1987. The game was initially developed for arcade machines and later ported to various home consoles and personal computers.

Dive into the adventure and take control of a small spacecraft called the R-9 that must fight its way through waves of enemy spacecraft and other obstacles. The game is known for its challenging difficulty, intricate level design, and innovative power-up system.

The player's spacecraft is armed with a primary weapon that fires energy bullets, as well as a limited supply of secondary weapons that can be acquired by collecting power-up items dropped by defeated enemies. The game also features a variety of boss battles, which require the player to carefully avoid incoming attacks while trying to damage the boss's weak points.
