## Contribution

If you want to add some content to the project you will need to follow the publishing steps. So let's see how our branches work.


Stage1-Testing : When you want to contribute, create a branch from this one with in name the feature that you want to add/modify. When your branch is done, merge it on Stage2-Testing, a serie of tests will be made on your branch to see if everything work coorectly, if it's all good you pass.

Stage2-Validation : You cannot merge on this branch without passing tests on Stage1-Testing. If you want to merge what has been done on Stage1 make a request a human testing will be made on the branch.

Master : Is the stable branch of the project, that the branch that players duplicate for play to the game. The merge on master will be made when our team will assess that there is enough novelty to release a new release for everyone.
